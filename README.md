# two-compartment-models-and-weak-electric-fields

Implementations of models and methods described in: __Ladenbauer, Obermayer,__ ___Weak electric fields promote resonance in neuronal spiking activity: analytical results from two-compartment cell and network models___ [PLOS Computational Biology 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006974) 

<!---
The code contains examples for the estimation of 

- background input statistics (Results section 2)
- input perturbations (Results section 3)
- synaptic coupling strengths (Results section 4)
- neuronal adaptation parameters (Results section 5)
-->

__How to use:__ 
run the script `run_me.py` with Python 2.x

<!---
_Required Python libraries_ 
numpy, scipy, numba, multiprocessing, math, os, collections, tables, time, matplotlib, warnings

These libraries can be conveniently obtained, for example, via a recent [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (Python 2.x)
-->
<!---
_Remark_: the code is a condensed version of the original implementations used for the paper, documentation and additional features will be included soon
